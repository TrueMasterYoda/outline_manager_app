# Outline Mobile Manager (Flutter)

A Flutter app focused on iOS for managing Outline VPN servers via the official Shadowbox Management API.

## Current capabilities

- Save multiple Outline server API URLs locally on-device.
- Browse access keys for each server.
- Create and delete access keys.
- View transfer usage and key limit metadata.

## Configure a server

When adding a server, use the full management API URL generated by your Outline server installation flow (for example, an URL ending in a secret path segment).

## Notes

- This app stores server entries using `shared_preferences`.
- API requests are made directly from device to server using `http`.
